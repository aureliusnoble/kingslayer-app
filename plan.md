## üö® REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUES

### Issue #4: Kick System & Room Change Notifications ‚ùå  
**Problem**: Kick buttons not working + missing full-screen kick notifications
- **Current**: KICK buttons appear but don't function, no room change modal
- **Required**: Working kick functionality + blocking full-screen notification for kicked players

### Issue #5: Role Card Display Wrong ‚ùå
**Problem**: Shows full role immediately instead of team background + eye toggle
- **Current**: Full role card with all details visible
- **Required**: Team background by default, eye icon to reveal role details

## üõ†Ô∏è DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - NEXT PRIORITIES

### Issue #2: Fix Role Reveal Ready State
**Priority**: HIGH - Prevents proper game flow

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Add Backend Handler**: Create `player_role_ready` socket event handler (already exists - verify it works correctly)
2. **Fix Frontend**: Update `RoleRevealScreen.tsx` to emit socket event instead of just local state
3. **Add State Sync**: Ensure all players must be role ready before advancing

### Issue #3: Leader Declaration System  
**Priority**: HIGH - Core gameplay mechanic

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Backend Method**: Add `declareLeader()` method to GameManager
2. **Socket Event**: Add `declare_leader` event handler
3. **Frontend UI**: Add "I AM THE LEADER" button and enhanced leader display
4. **Kick Buttons**: Show kick buttons for leaders when timer = 0

### Issue #4: Room Kick Notifications
**Priority**: MEDIUM - UX improvement

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Backend Events**: Enhance `send_player` handler to emit proper `room_assignment` events
2. **Frontend Modal**: Create `KickNotificationModal` component for full-screen notifications
3. **State Management**: Add kick notification state to game store

### Issue #5: Role Card Display
**Priority**: LOW - UX improvement

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Team Card Component**: Create `TeamRoleCard` with eye toggle functionality
2. **Update Screens**: Replace role displays in `RoleRevealScreen` and `GameScreen`
3. **Eye Toggle State**: Implement show/hide role details functionality

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY ORDER

### Immediate (Next 2-4 hours):
1. **Issue #2: Role Reveal Ready State** - Fix game flow progression
2. **Issue #3: Leader Declaration System** - Add core gameplay mechanic
3. **Issue #4: Room Kick Notifications** - Complete kick functionality

### Short Term (Next 4-8 hours):
4. **Issue #5: Role Card Display** - Improve user experience
5. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end game flow testing

### Testing Strategy:
- Fix one issue at a time
- Test each fix immediately with comprehensive test scripts
- Ensure no regressions from previous fixes
- Focus on core gameplay functionality first

## LONG-TERM ROADMAP



### Phase 2: Enhanced UX and Polish (Future)
- Full-screen role card display
- Better error handling and loading states
- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility improvements

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Current Functional Requirements
- ‚úÖ Games can be created and joined successfully
- ‚úÖ All player counts (6-14) work correctly  
- ‚úÖ Role assignments work for all roles
- ‚úÖ Complete navigation works (create ‚Üí lobby ‚Üí role reveal ‚Üí game)
- ‚úÖ Timer system works correctly (2min countdown from game start)
- ‚ùå Role reveal ready state works properly
- ‚ùå Leader declaration system functions
- ‚ùå Room kick notifications work
- ‚ùå Role card display with team background/eye toggle

### Technical Requirements Status
- ‚úÖ Real-time synchronization works reliably
- ‚úÖ Frontend state management is predictable  
- ‚úÖ Socket connections are resilient
- ‚úÖ Navigation flow is bug-free
- ‚úÖ Timer system is correctly implemented
- ‚úÖ Development debugging is comprehensive

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Start with Issue #2** - Fix role reveal ready state bug (highest impact)
2. **Continue with Issue #3** - Implement leader declaration system
3. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure each fix works before moving to next
4. **Document changes** - Update this plan as issues are resolved

The app now has a solid foundation with working navigation, timer system, and real-time synchronization. The remaining issues are focused on completing core gameplay mechanics and improving user experience.
